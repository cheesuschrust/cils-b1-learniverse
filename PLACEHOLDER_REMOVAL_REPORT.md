# Placeholder Removal Report

This document tracks the changes made to replace mock data and placeholders with real functionality.

## Services and API Structure

- Created `api.ts` as the central point for API interactions
- Added service classes for Authentication, User, and Content with proper interfaces
- Implemented simulated API calls that will later be replaced with real backend calls

## Authentication

- Replaced hardcoded user data with a proper authentication flow
- Added local storage for session persistence
- Implemented login, register, and logout functionality
- Added password hashing for security

## Flashcards

- Created a useFlashcards hook to manage flashcard data
- Implemented CRUD operations for flashcards
- Added proper error handling and loading states

## User Profile

- Connected profile management to the user service
- Implemented profile updates with proper validation
- Added password update functionality

## Navigation

- Updated navigation components to be context-aware
- Fixed routes and navigation structure
- Added conditional rendering based on authentication state

## UI Components

- Updated Logo component with proper Italian flag gradient
- Improved mobile menu with proper navigation

## Remaining Tasks

1. Implement proper backend API endpoints
2. Add real-time data synchronization
3. Implement proper user authentication with JWT
4. Add file upload for user avatars and content
5. Implement multi-language support properly
6. Connect to external services for content enrichment

## Conclusion

All major placeholder and mock implementations have been refactored to use a service-based architecture. The app is now structured to easily replace the simulated API with real backend calls when they become available.
