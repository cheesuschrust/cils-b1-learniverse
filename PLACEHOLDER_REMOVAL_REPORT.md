# Placeholder Removal Report - UPDATED

This document tracks the changes made to replace mock data and placeholders with real functionality.

## COMPLETED: Services and API Structure

- Created `api.ts` as the central point for API interactions ✅
- Added service classes for Authentication, User, and Content with proper interfaces ✅
- Implemented simulated API calls with structured data that will be easy to replace with real backend calls ✅
- Added error handling and logging for API calls ✅

## COMPLETED: Authentication

- Replaced hardcoded user data with a proper authentication flow ✅
- Added local storage for session persistence ✅
- Implemented login, register, and logout functionality ✅
- Added password hashing for security ✅
- Fixed navigation after login to prevent 404 errors ✅
- Implemented social login simulation ✅
- Added proper password reset flow ✅

## COMPLETED: User Profile

- Connected profile management to the user service ✅
- Implemented profile updates with proper validation ✅
- Added password update functionality ✅
- Fixed preferences updating in user profiles ✅
- Ensured UserPreferencesContext works properly without circular dependencies ✅

## COMPLETED: Navigation

- Updated navigation components to be context-aware ✅
- Fixed routes and navigation structure ✅
- Added conditional rendering based on authentication state ✅
- Added redirect from old dashboard path to new path ✅
- Ensured NotFound page provides useful information ✅

## COMPLETED: Type Safety

- Fixed type definitions in AuthContext ✅
- Exported necessary types from shared-types ✅
- Updated component interfaces to match required types ✅
- Resolved all TypeScript errors ✅
- Added proper typings for all stub implementations ✅

## COMPLETED: UI Components

- Updated error pages with better user guidance ✅
- Improved toast notifications for better user feedback ✅
- Fixed form validation across the application ✅
- Made UserPreferences component more robust ✅

## COMPLETED: Mock Database

- Replaced with structured data store that simulates a database ✅
- Added password hashing for security ✅
- Implemented proper user data structure ✅
- Added methods for CRUD operations on users ✅

## COMPLETED: Error Handling

- Added comprehensive error handling in API calls ✅
- Improved error messages in authentication flows ✅
- Added console logging for better debugging ✅
- Ensured all errors are properly caught and displayed to users ✅

## REMAINING TASKS FOR FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION

1. Connect to a real backend API (when available)
2. Implement real-time data synchronization
3. Add file upload functionality for user avatars
4. Optimize performance for mobile devices

## CONCLUSION

All placeholder and mock implementations have been refactored to use a service-based architecture with proper typing. The app now uses a structured approach to simulate API calls that can be easily replaced with real backend calls when they become available. All TypeScript errors have been resolved, and the application now correctly navigates between pages without 404 errors.

The circular dependency between AuthContext and UserPreferencesContext has been resolved, ensuring the app loads properly without runtime errors. All components now use the correct types and interfaces, and all forms validate user input properly.
